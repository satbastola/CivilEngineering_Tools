    "### Definition\n",
    "**Sustainable concrete** refers to concrete designed and produced to minimize environmental impact while maintaining structural performance. It incorporates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) like fly ash, slag, silica fume, and calcined clays  \n",
    "- Recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste  \n",
    "- Low-carbon binders and alternative fuels in cement production  \n",
    "- Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies  \n",
    "\n",
