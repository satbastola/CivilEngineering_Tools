    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Wall Area Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The total wall surface area is calculated assuming a rectangular house with four vertical walls. This area is essential for scaling thermal performance metrics and estimating total heat loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formula:**  \n",
    "  $( A = 2h(l + w) $)  \n",
    "  where $( h $) is wall height, $( l $) is house length, and $( w $) is house width.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: U-value Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The U-value represents the rate of heat transfer through the wall per unit area per unit temperature difference. It is the inverse of the total thermal resistance of the wall layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thermal Resistance of Each Layer:**  \n",
    "  $$( R_i = \\frac{\\text{thickness}_i}{\\text{conductivity}_i} )$$\n",

    "  $$( U = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This step accounts for all existing wall materials (e.g., brick, plaster) and their thermal properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Insulation Thickness Suggestion\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet a target U-value, the calculator estimates the additional thermal resistance required and converts it into insulation thickness using the conductivity of the chosen insulation material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Required Resistance:**  \n",
    "  $( R_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{1}{U_{\\text{target}}} $)\n",

    "  $( R_{\\text{insulation}} = R_{\\text{required}} - R_{\\text{base}} $)\n",

    "- **Suggested Thickness:**  \n",
    "  $( \\text{Thickness} = R_{\\text{insulation}} \\times k_{\\text{insulation}} $)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the existing wall already meets or exceeds the target resistance, no insulation is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Performance Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculated U-value is interpreted against the target and typical climate standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Meets Target:** Efficient insulation\n",
    "- **Moderate Insulation:** May benefit from improvement\n",
    "- **Poor Insulation:** Likely to cause high energy costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This qualitative feedback helps users understand the implications of their wall design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Climate Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculator compares the wall‚Äôs U-value against typical standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cold Climate:** ‚â§ 0.25 W/m¬≤¬∑K  \n",
    "- **Moderate Climate:** ‚â§ 0.35 W/m¬≤¬∑K  \n",
    "- **Warm Climate:** ‚â§ 0.50 W/m¬≤¬∑K\n",
    "\n",
    "This contextualizes the thermal performance based on regional energy efficiency expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology integrates geometric modeling, material science, and energy efficiency principles to provide actionable insights for improving wall insulation. It supports decision-making for retrofitting, design optimization, and compliance with building standards.\n",
