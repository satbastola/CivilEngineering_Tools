    "\n",
    "**Landscape water conservation** refers to the strategic design, management, and maintenance of outdoor spaces to **minimize water use** while maintaining healthy vegetation and ecosystem services. It plays a critical role in **urban water sustainability**, especially in regions with seasonal drought or limited freshwater resources.\n",
