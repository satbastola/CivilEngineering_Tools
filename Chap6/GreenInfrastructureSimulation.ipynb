    "\n",
    "Green infrastructure in the U.S. is evolving from isolated stormwater fixes to **multi-functional, climate-resilient systems**. It restores the **natural capacity of ecosystems** to filter, absorb, and recycle, while also addressing **social equity, urban livability, and long-term sustainability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Green infrastructure is not just a technical fix—it’s a **philosophical shift** toward designing with nature rather than against it. It reestablishes the **self-regulating capacity** of ecosystems, enabling them to **filter, cycle, and heal**—functions that are foundational to long-term resilience and sustainability.\n",
