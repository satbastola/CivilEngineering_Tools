    "\n",
    "- **Short piles in clay** → Use friction-only method with conservative α values.\n",
    "- **Long piles in sand** → Use combined method; ensure tip reaches dense strata.\n",
    "- **Group piles** → Apply efficiency factor (0.7–0.9) to account for reduced capacity due to spacing and stress overlap.\n",
    "- **Diameter vs. Length** → Larger diameter increases tip area; longer length increases shaft resistance.\n",
