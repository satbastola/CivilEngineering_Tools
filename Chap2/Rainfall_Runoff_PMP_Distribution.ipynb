    "### Applications of Disaggregated Rainfall in Hydrologic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Disaggregated rainfall ‚Äî rainfall broken into fine time intervals ‚Äî is essential for dynamic hydrologic modeling. It allows engineers and scientists to simulate how rainfall intensity and timing affect runoff, infiltration, flooding, and infrastructure performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Runoff Modeling**\n",
    "Disaggregated rainfall is used to generate time-varying runoff in models like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rational Method**: Peak runoff \\( Q = CiA \\) depends on rainfall intensity \\( i \\) over the time of concentration.\n",
    "- **HEC-HMS**, **SWMM**: Use rainfall time series to produce hydrographs showing flow over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Flood Routing**\n",
    "Inflow hydrographs derived from disaggregated rainfall are routed through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reservoirs** (e.g., level pool routing)\n",
    "- **Channels** (e.g., Muskingum method)\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps simulate **lag**, **attenuation**, and **peak timing** of flood waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Stormwater Infrastructure Design**\n",
    "Designing detention basins, culverts, and storm sewers requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimating **peak inflow rate**\n",
    "- Calculating **required storage volume**\n",
    "- Evaluating **duration of overflow events**\n",
    "\n",
    "Disaggregated rainfall provides the temporal detail needed for these calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Infiltration and Soil Moisture Modeling**\n",
    "Rainfall intensity affects infiltration in models like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Green-Ampt**\n",
    "- **Horton**\n",
    "\n",
    "Disaggregated rainfall helps simulate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ponding**\n",
    "- **Saturation**\n",
    "- **Excess runoff generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Erosion and Sediment Transport**\n",
    "High-intensity rainfall drives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soil detachment**\n",
    "- **Sediment yield**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in models like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WEPP**\n",
    "- **SWAT**\n",
    "\n",
    "Disaggregated rainfall identifies **erosive bursts** and **transport thresholds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** Total rainfall depth = 50 mm, duration = 3 hours  \n",
    "2. **Disaggregation:** Break into 10-minute intervals using a triangular or SCS distribution  \n",
    "3. **Hydrologic Model:** Use rainfall time series in SWMM to simulate urban runoff  \n",
    "4. **Output:** Hydrograph showing peak flow at 1.2 hours, total runoff volume = 35 mm  \n",
    "5. **Design Decision:** Size detention basin to handle peak flow and store excess volume\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal resolution** affects the accuracy of peak flow estimates  \n",
    "- **Design storms** must reflect realistic rainfall patterns  \n",
    "- **Regulatory compliance** often requires specific distributions (e.g., SCS Type II)\n",
