    "### Rainfall frequency analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall frequency analysis helps engineers and planners estimate how often specific rainfall events are likely to occur, such as a ‚Äú10-year storm.‚Äù These statistics are essential for designing drainage infrastructure, managing flood risks, and sizing stormwater systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCS Curve Number (CN) method is a widely used empirical approach that estimates surface runoff from rainfall based on land use, soil type, and hydrologic conditions. When paired with frequency-based rainfall inputs from NOAA Atlas 14, it enables realistic modeling of watershed response across various return periods and storm durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This learning module is designed to reinforce your understanding of:\n",
    "- How rainfall depth varies with return period across different durations\n",
    "- The role of CN in shaping runoff response\n",
    "- The interplay between frequency-based rainfall and runoff generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the questions and quiz below to apply these concepts and reflect on their real-world implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOAA Rainfall Frequency & SCS Runoff Estimation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This script visualizes rainfall depth-frequency data from a NOAA Atlas 14 CSV file and estimates runoff using the SCS Curve Number method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Rainfall Frequency & Runoff Estimation Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive tool uses precipitation frequency data (from NOAA Atlas 14) to estimate surface runoff using two common hydrologic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **SCS Curve Number (CN) Method**\n",
    "-  **Rational Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables side-by-side exploration of how different design storms (e.g., 2-year, 25-year) and watershed conditions affect runoff depth or peak discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCS Curve Number (CN) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCS method estimates runoff volume based on total storm depth and watershed characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q = \\frac{(P - I_a)^2}{P - I_a + S}, \\quad \\text{with } I_a = 0.2S \\text{ and } S = \\frac{25400}{CN} - 254\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( Q \\): runoff depth (mm)\n",
    "- \\( P \\): rainfall depth (mm)\n",
    "- \\( CN \\): Curve Number (dimensionless, 30‚Äì100)\n",
    "- \\( S \\): maximum potential retention (mm)\n",
    "- \\( I_a \\): initial abstraction (mm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this method when estimating total **runoff depth** from a storm event for a given land cover and soil condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rational Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rational formula estimates **peak runoff rate** based on rainfall intensity and watershed area.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q = C \\cdot I \\cdot A \\cdot 0.00278\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( Q \\): peak runoff (m¬≥/s)\n",
    "- \\( C \\): runoff coefficient (depends on land use)\n",
    "- \\( I \\): rainfall intensity (mm/hr)\n",
    "- \\( A \\): drainage area (hectares)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is most appropriate for small urban catchments with short time of concentration, where peak flow is the design priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore:\n",
    "- **Storm durations** (e.g., 1-hr, 6-hr, 24-hr) from NOAA frequency tables\n",
    "- **Return periods** (e.g., 2-year, 100-year)\n",
    "- **Runoff parameters**:\n",
    "  - Curve Number (30‚Äì100) for the SCS method\n",
    "  - Runoff coefficient \\( C \\) and drainage area (ha) for the Rational method\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rainfall depth or intensity vs. return period\n",
    "- Runoff (depth or peak flow) vs. return period\n",
    "- Tabular summaries comparing inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how watershed characteristics influence runoff response\n",
    "- Compare SCS and Rational methods under varying storm scenarios\n",
    "- Visualize how design rainfall translates to discharge for infrastructure sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic CSV Processing:**\n",
    "  - Loads NOAA rainfall frequency data (e.g., \"All_Depth_English_PDS.csv\")\n",
    "  - Extracts durations and return periods (e.g., 2-year, 10-year storms)\n",
    "  - Converts rainfall depths from inches to mm for SCS runoff estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** Rainfall Frequency Visualization:**\n",
    "  - Static plot of rainfall depth vs. return period across multiple durations\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** SCS Runoff Calculation:**\n",
    "  - Implements standard SCS runoff formula:\n",
    "    - Curve Number (CN) adjustable via slider (range: 30‚Äì100)\n",
    "  - Rational runoff calculation\n",
    "  - \n",
    "- ** Interactive Analysis:**\n",
    "  - Interactive plot comparing rainfall depth and resulting runoff for selected storm duration\n",
    "  - Tabular output showing return period vs. rainfall and runoff\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hydrologic modeling\n",
    "- Stormwater system design\n",
    "- Educational demonstrations of rainfall-runoff relationships\n",
    "üí° Use cases include urban drainage design, floodplain analysis, and stormwater infrastructure planning."

    "### Learning Module: Rainfall Frequency & Runoff Estimation Using SCS and Rational Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This module supports your interactive Python tool by providing conceptual clarity, reflective exploration, and quiz-style knowledge checks related to runoff estimation using NOAA rainfall frequency data and two widely used hydrologic models: the SCS Curve Number method and the Rational Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What does the Curve Number (CN) represent, and how does it influence runoff depth?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Consider the influence of land use, soil type, and antecedent moisture.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why does rainfall intensity (in mm/hr) play a central role in the Rational Method but not in the SCS method?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: One method emphasizes peak flow, the other emphasizes volume.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does the return period (e.g. 2-year vs. 100-year) affect runoff behavior in both models?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Think about depth vs. frequency relationships.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why is the rainfall depth converted from inches to millimeters before applying the runoff equations?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Unit consistency is critical when using empirical formulas.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What assumptions are made when converting NOAA depth-frequency values into intensity for the Rational Method?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Watch for simplifications related to storm duration.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Reflective Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In what types of catchments would the Rational Method be more appropriate than the SCS method?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Consider urbanization, size, and design focus.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What might happen if a user selects a high Curve Number and long return period storm in a small catchment?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Consider runoff magnitude and infrastructure capacity.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How would changing the runoff coefficient \\( C \\) from 0.3 (grassy slope) to 0.9 (paved lot) impact peak discharge estimates?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Explore impact on Rational runoff outcomes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the limitations of using historical frequency data in a changing climate context?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Are past trends always reliable for future design?*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How can this tool be enhanced to support distributed (spatially variable) modeling within large watersheds?**  \n",
    "   üîé *Hint: Think about grid-based CN and C mapping.*\n",
