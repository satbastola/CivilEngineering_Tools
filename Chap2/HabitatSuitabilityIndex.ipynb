    "Human interventions like **dam construction**, **channelization**, and **river regulation** aim to reduce natural flow variability for flood control, irrigation, and hydropower. However, these often lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåä Ecological Consequences {cite:p}`usgs2001habitat`\n",
    "- **Habitat degradation**: Loss of riffles, pools, and floodplain connectivity\n",
    "- **Fragmentation**: Barriers to fish migration and gene flow\n",
    "- **Altered flow regimes**: Disruption of seasonal cues for spawning and feeding\n",
    "- **Thermal pollution**: Stratification and cold-water releases downstream\n",
    "- **Sediment retention**: Starvation of downstream habitats and delta erosion\n",
    "- **Biodiversity loss**: Decline in native fish, macroinvertebrates, and aquatic plants\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ Habitat Analysis\n",
    "The study of physical, biological, and ecological conditions that support species survival, reproduction, and persistence. It involves assessing habitat **quality**, **availability**, and **suitability** for target organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ Hydraulics\n",
    "The science of water movement through natural or engineered channels. In habitat studies, it focuses on **flow depth**, **velocity**, **shear stress**, and **inundation patterns** that shape aquatic environments.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Hydraulic conditions define habitat structure**: Flow depth, velocity, and substrate interaction determine where species can live, feed, and spawn.\n",
    "- **Habitat suitability is species-specific**: Different species prefer distinct hydraulic niches (e.g., slow shallow water for larvae, fast riffles for adults).\n",
    "- **Hydraulic modeling enables habitat prediction**: Simulations help assess habitat availability under varying flow regimes, especially in regulated rivers.\n",
    "> Over 60% of large rivers are now fragmented by dams, with severe consequences for aquatic biodiversity. Most sttides show negative ecolocial changes in respose to a variety of flow alteration {cite:p}`poff2010ecological`\n",
