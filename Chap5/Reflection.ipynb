    "- {cite}`USACE1984` discusses wave reflection primarily through empirical coefficients and design charts, focusing on vertical walls and rubble-mound structures. It emphasizes how slope, roughness, and wave steepness affect reflection, but uses simplified linear theory and limited irregular wave treatment. {cite}`USACE2002` expands the treatment with more rigorous methods, including reflection coefficients for monochromatic and irregular waves, and accounts for structure geometry, permeability, and wave breaking. It integrates laboratory data and numerical modeling for design applications."
