    "### Interactive Beach Profile Evaluation Based on SPM Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook tool provides an interactive evaluation of coastal beach profiles using key parameters inspired by the **Shore Protection Manual (SPM)**. It assesses whether a beach is **reflective**, **dissipative**, or **intermediate**, and estimates **stability** based on sediment mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the following parameters using sliders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wave Height (Hb)**: Represents significant wave height in meters.\n",
    "- **Wave Period (T)**: Time interval between wave crests in seconds.\n",
    "- **Beach Slope (tan β)**: Indicates the steepness of the beach profile.\n",
    "- **Sediment Size (D50)**: Median grain size of beach sediment in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coastal Metrics Computed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wave Steepness** \\( S = \\frac{H_b}{L_0} \\): Measures relative wave height to wavelength.\n",
    "- **Iribarren Number** \\( Ir = \\frac{\\tan \\beta}{\\sqrt{H_b / L_0}} \\): Surf similarity parameter.\n",
    "- **Mobility Ratio** \\( M = \\frac{H_b}{w_f} \\): Compares wave energy to sediment settling ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the inputs, the profile is classified as:\n",
    "\n",

    "|------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Ir > 3.3          | Reflective Profile       |\n",
    "| Ir < 0.3          | Dissipative Profile      |\n",
    "| 0.3 ≤ Ir ≤ 3.3    | Intermediate Profile     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sediment mobility determines:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mobility Ratio | Stability Status        |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------------------|\n",

    "| > 300          | Likely Unstable         |\n",
    "| 100–300        | Possibly Transitional   |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you adjust the sliders, the tool recalculates the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep-water wavelength \\( L_0 \\)\n",
    "- Wave steepness\n",
    "- Iribarren number\n",
    "- Sediment fall velocity (approximate)\n",
