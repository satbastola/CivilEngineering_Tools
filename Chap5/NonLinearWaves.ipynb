    "### 🌊 Nonlinear Coastal Waves and Stokes Theory — Overview for Coastal Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Several wave theories are used to characterize the **profile**, **kinematics**, **energy**, and other dynamic parameters of water waves. These theories are typically categorized based on the **linearity** of the wave motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Wave Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Airy (Linear) Theory** - Assumes wave symmetry about the still water level. - Described using a cosine function. - Models only **oscillatory waves**. - Applicable to **deep water** and **low-amplitude** conditions. - Simple and widely used in engineering design. - May oversimplify results due to idealized assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinear Wave Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stokes Theory** - Suitable for **intermediate to deep water**. - Handles **moderate wave steepness**. - Solutions increase in complexity with each higher-order term. - Commonly used up to 3rd-order; tabulated solutions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cnoidal Wave Theory** - Best for **shallow water** and **long-period waves**. - Accounts for **asymmetric wave profiles**. - Solutions derived from tabulated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solitary Wave Theory** - Models **purely translatory waves**. - Assumes **infinite wavelength**. - Useful for tsunami modeling and wave propagation in channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **{cite}`USACE1984`** introduces Airy (linear) wave theory and applies it to coastal design, forming the basis for wave force calculations on structures. **{cite}`DeanDalrymple2001`** provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of nonlinear wave mechanics, including derivations, applicability limits, and engineering implications. It provides a foundational treatment of nonlinear wave theories—including Stokes, cnoidal, solitary, and stream function models—emphasizing analytical solutions, tabulated values, and engineering applicability across various water depths. Their work is widely used in education and design for its clarity and practical focus. In contrast, **{cite}`Fenton1999`** advances the numerical modeling of nonlinear waves using Fourier series and iterative techniques, offering high-order accuracy and fully nonlinear solutions suitable for research and complex coastal applications. Together, these references form a complementary framework: Dean for conceptual understanding and design, Fenton for precision modeling and computational implementation."

    "### ⚙️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculates surface elevation $( \\eta(x,t) $) using:\n",
    "  - Airy: cosine-based formula assuming irrotational flow\n",
    "  - Trochoidal: sine-based formula with circular particle paths\n",
    "- Uses wave height `H`, period `T`, and time `t` as adjustable inputs\n",
    "- Plots both wave profiles over one wavelength for comparison\n",
