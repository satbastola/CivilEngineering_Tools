    "#### Interactive Wave Spectrum Comparison: PM vs JONSWAP\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the fundamental differences between the **Pierson–Moskowitz (PM)** and **JONSWAP** wave spectra—two widely used models to describe the energy distribution of sea surface waves generated by wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the theoretical foundations of the PM and JONSWAP spectra\n",
    "- Explore how wave energy is distributed over frequency for varying wind speeds\n",
    "- Examine the effect of spectral peakedness through the JONSWAP γ (gamma) parameter\n",
    "- Interpret real-time spectral plots using interactive sliders\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pierson–Moskowitz (PM) Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The PM spectrum models a **fully developed sea** where waves have grown under consistent wind over time and space. It assumes the sea is in equilibrium and is controlled primarily by wind speed \\( U_{10} \\) at 10 meters above the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral shape is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{PM}(f) = \\alpha \\frac{g^2}{(2\\pi)^4} f^{-5} \\exp\\left[-1.25 \\left( \\frac{f_p}{f} \\right)^4 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 🌐 JONSWAP Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The **JONSWAP spectrum** extends PM by introducing a **peak enhancement factor \\( \\gamma \\)** to account for young, developing seas. It narrows the spectral peak and adds asymmetry to the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{JONSWAP}(f) = S_{PM}(f) \\cdot \\gamma^{\\exp \\left[ - \\frac{(f - f_p)^2}{2 \\sigma^2 f_p^2} \\right]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( f_p \\): peak frequency, inversely related to wind speed\n",
    "- \\( \\gamma \\): spectral peakedness (default ≈ 3.3)\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\): frequency-dependent bandwidth (0.07 if \\( f < f_p \\), else 0.09)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interactive Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the sliders below to change:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wind speed \\( U_{10} \\)** (in m/s): influences peak frequency and total energy\n",
    "- **Gamma (γ)**: controls the sharpness and intensity of the JONSWAP peak\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation will regenerate and plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **PM spectrum** (solid line)\n",
    "- The **JONSWAP spectrum** (dashed line)\n",
    "\n",
    "All curves are plotted against frequency in Hz with spectral energy density in m²/Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher wind speeds** shift the peak to lower frequencies (longer waves)\n",
    "- **Larger γ values** sharpen the JONSWAP spectrum, representing more \"peaky\" wave energy\n",
    "- The **difference between spectra** highlights stages of sea development (from growing to fully developed)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
