    "{cite}`dolman2019biogeochemical` is particularly useful for civil engineers interested in watershed modeling, climate adaptation, nutrient management, and environmental system design. {cite}`freney1982cycling` focuses on the interactions among the C, N, S, and P cycles, especially under anthropogenic pressures such as fossil fuel combustion, land-use change, and acid rain. This book offers a Historical grounding in nutrient cycle theory prior to the rise of Earth system models, conceptual clarity on nutrient interactions and limiting factors, and useful diagrams and tables for illustrating coupled cycles in teaching modules. {cite}`farquhar1980photosynthesis` presents a mechanistic model that integrates biochemical processes of photosynthesis with leaf-level gas exchange measurements. It remains the foundation for modeling C₃ photosynthesis in plant physiology, crop modeling, and Earth system science."
