    "A **dam** is a hydraulic structure constructed across a river, stream, or watercourse to **store, control, or divert water** for various purposes. In water resources engineering, dams play a critical role in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Water supply** for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use\n",
    "- **Flood control** by regulating downstream flow\n",
    "- **Hydropower generation** through controlled release of water\n",
    "- **Irrigation** by maintaining reservoir levels\n",
    "- **Navigation** by stabilizing river flow\n",
    "- **Recreation and ecosystem support**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dams are designed to withstand hydraulic, structural, and environmental loads, and their type and configuration depend on **site topography**, **geology**, **hydrology**, and **intended function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Dam classification\n",
    "Dams can be classified based on several criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ By Hydraulic Design\n",
    "- **Overflow dams**: e.g., concrete dams that allow water to spill over.\n",
    "- **Non-overflow dams**: e.g., embankment dams that retain water without overtopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ By Structural Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gravity Dam** - Relies on its own weight to resist water pressure. - Typically made of concrete or masonry. - Suitable for wide valleys with strong foundations.  Gravity Dams depend on weight for stability against overturning, sliding, and crushing.\n",
    "- Optimization involves:\n",
    "  - Using ¬º to ‚Öì of concrete volume to counter uplift.\n",
    "  - ¬æ to ‚Öî volume for resisting overturning and shear.\n",
    "  - Inclined upstream face can improve stress distribution.\n",
    "- **Hollow gravity dams** are lighter alternatives with similar design principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Arch Dam**- Curved upstream to transfer loads to abutments. - Requires strong, stable rock walls. - Economical in narrow, steep-sided valleys.\n",
    "- Components: - **Arch unit**: bounded by horizontal planes - **Cantilever unit**: bounded by vertical radial planes - **Extrados**: upstream face- **Intrados**: downstream face\n",
    "- Advantages: - Material-efficient and cheaper - Minor uplift issues due to narrow base - Can be built on moderate foundations\n",
    "- Disadvantages: - Require strong rock abutments - Specialized design and slow construction - Skilled labor and complex formwork needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buttress Dam** - Consists of a sloping deck supported by buttresses. - Uses less material than gravity dams. - Suitable for moderate foundations and wider valleys. Buttress Dam require less concrete than gravity dams.\n",
    "- Advantages: - Efficient heat dissipation ‚Üí faster construction - Safer against overturning/sliding due to inclined face- Better stress distribution on foundation - Suitable for weaker foundations\n",
    "- Disadvantages: - Require more reinforcement and skilled labor - Expensive formwork - High stress on slabs/columns ‚Üí potential deterioration\n",

    "-{cite}`usbr1976gravitydams`- Serves as a technical guide for designing concrete gravity dams of all heights (except those under 50 feet, which are addressed in Design of Small Dams). The book emphasizes sound engineering practices, safety, and environmental stewardship. The design principle encompasses 1) stability requirements (against overturning, sliding, and foundation failure), 2) various load types (dead load, hydrostatic, uplift, and silt), and 3) analysis methods (Gravity, trial-load, and finite element method).  \n",

    "-{cite}`usbr1976gravitydams`emphasizes empirical design based on historical Bureau practices, focusing on static stability checks and construction detailing. In contrast, {cite}`usace1995gravitydam` manual adopts a more analytical and performance-based approach, integrating dynamic analysis, reevaluation of existing dams, and modern computational tools. While both assume rock foundations and cover sliding, overturning, and stress checks, USACE provides deeper guidance on seismic response and uplift modeling.{cite}`novak2007hydraulic` provides a comprehensive and engineering-focused treatment of gravity dam design, covering structural stability, uplift pressure, seepage control, and modern safety considerations.
