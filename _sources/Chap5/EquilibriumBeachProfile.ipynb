    "An equilibrium beach profile refers to a coastal state in which the net sand transport into or out of a littoral cell does not alter the shape of the beach, resulting in a stable shoreline. This condition occurs under consistent wave and water level impacts. However, equilibrium is typically short-lived, as wave energy and water levels are dynamic and continuously changing.\n",

    "The equilibrium beach profile (EBP), defined by h = Ay^{2/3}, models how beaches adjust to wave energy and sediment properties {cite}`dean1994`, {cite}`DeanDalrymple2001`. The Bruun Rule predicts that sea level rise causes the entire profile to shift landward and upward, leading to shoreline retreat {cite}`Bruun1962`,{cite}`USACE2011`. This assumption is based on a stable profile shape, no longshore transport, and a sediment budget bounded by the depth of closure. Dean‚Äôs refinements link profile steepness to sediment grain size and wave climate. Coastal structures can interrupt this adjustment, often accelerating erosion and preventing natural shoreline migration {cite}`USACE2011`. "
