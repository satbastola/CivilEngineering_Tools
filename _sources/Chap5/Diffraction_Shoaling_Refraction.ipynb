    "{cite}`Bettess1984` presents a finite element approach to modeling wave diffraction around breakwaters using Berkhoff’s mild-slope equation, a governing equation that accounts for both refraction and diffraction in varying bathymetry. {cite}`CERC1984` uses the diffraction coefficient (derived for a semi-infinite impermeable breakwater) defined as the ratio of diffracted wave height to incident wave height. The diffraction diagrams in the Shore Protection Manual are derived from a Fresnel-type solution (simplified and adapted for practical coastal engineering use) for semi-infinite breakwaters.\n",

    "## 🌊 Interactive Wave Transformation Explorer — Shoaling & Refraction Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python-based Jupyter widget tool visualizes how **wave energy changes** as waves move into shallower water, using principles of **shoaling and refraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave refraction and shoaling are thoroughly described in the {cite}`CERT1984` (Volume 1). The wave refraction is modeled based on Snell's Law and conservation of energy. For shoaling transformation, the manual uses the shoaling coefficient tables for various depths and wave periods. The combined refraction-shaling nomograms are available for rapid estimation.  \n",

    "### 🧠 What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computes:\n",
    "  - **Wave celerity ($C$)**: speed of wave propagation at varying depths\n",
    "  - **Shoaling coefficient ($K_s$)**: change in wave height due to depth-induced slowing\n",
    "  - **Refraction coefficient ($K_r$)**: angular redistribution of wave energy due to changing wave direction in shallower depths\n",
    "- Produces dynamic plots of $K_s$ and $K_r$ vs. water depth\n",
    "- Provides real-time control via sliders for wave period and wave angle\n",

    "  - **Shoaling coefficient $K_s$** — increases as depth decreases, amplifying wave height\n",
    "  - **Refraction coefficient $K_r$** — varies with wave angle, showing energy focusing or dispersion\n",
    "- Both coefficients plotted against water depth from 30m to 1m\n",
    "- Depth axis reversed to emphasize shoreline approach\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 How to Interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High $K_s$ at shallow depths** → wave height increases, stronger surf\n",
    "- **Variable $K_r$** → shows influence of wave angle on energy concentration\n",
    "- Tool helps explore coastal wave transformations relevant to beach design, sediment transport, and surf forecasting\n",
