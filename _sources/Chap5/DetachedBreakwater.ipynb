    "### What Are Detached Breakwaters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Detached breakwaters are **shore-parallel coastal structures** placed offshore to reduce wave energy reaching the beach. They are typically constructed from rock, concrete, or lightweight materials and may be:\n",
    "- **Emerged** (above water level)\n",
    "- **Submerged** (low-crested)\n",
    "- **Segmented** (with gaps between units)\n",
    "\n",
    "Their primary goals are:\n",
    "- To **dissipate wave energy**\n",
    "- To **modify sediment transport**\n",
    "- To **promote beach accretion** and reduce erosion\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Design of detached breakwaters involves balancing:\n",
    "- **Hydrodynamic performance** (wave transmission, reflection)\n",
    "- **Morphological response** (salient or tombolo formation)\n",
    "- **Environmental impact** (habitat, circulation)\n",
    "- **Constructability and cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key geometric parameters:\n",
    "- $( L_s $): Breakwater length  \n",
    "- $( X $): Distance offshore  \n",
    "- $( L_s/X $): Governs shoreline response\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical studies (e.g., Gourlay, CERC, Suh & Dalrymple) guide design thresholds:\n",
    "- $( L_s/X < 0.5 $): Limited response  \n",
    "- $( 0.5 < L_s/X < 1.5 $): Salient formation  \n",
    "- $( L_s/X > 1.5 $): Tombolo formation\n",

    "### Shoreline Response Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Salient**\n",
    "- Bell-shaped shoreline protrusion\n",
    "- Does not connect to breakwater\n",
    "- Allows partial wave energy and sediment flow\n",
    "- Less risk of downstream erosion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tombolo**\n",
    "- Sand accumulation connects beach to breakwater\n",
    "- Creates sheltered zone\n",
    "- May cause upstream accretion and downstream erosion\n",
    "- Often forms when $( L_s/X > 1.5 $)\n",

    "{cite}`USACE2011` also provides  a clear and formal description of depth of closure (DoC), particularly in Part VI – Design of Coastal Structures. {cite}`CERC1984`remains a cornerstone reference, offering empirical guidance and design principles for rubble-mound structures and beach profile evolution. Developed by the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC), it laid the groundwork for subsequent refinements in coastal engineering theory and practice. Works such as {cite}`DallyPope1986` and {cite}`SuhDalrymple1987` advanced the design and performance evaluation of detached breakwaters through laboratory and field studies. {cite}`McCormick1993` expanded the design framework to include innovative stabilization techniques and practical guidelines for coastal infrastructure. Collectively, these references provide a robust foundation for understanding the depth of closure, sediment transport limits, and structural interactions in dynamic coastal environments.\n",
